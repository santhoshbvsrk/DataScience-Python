# Python Data Science Starters

This is project is created as part of my learning and sharing knowledge.

In this project, I've touched upon most of the basic Python coding concepts one should know to begin their Data Science journey with Python as Scripting Language.

I've tried to touch base on the concepts like:

1. [What are Functions & how to pass Arguments](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/Arguments-Function.ipynb)
2. [What are Comments & how to give comments in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/Comments%20in%20Python.ipynb)
3. [Control flow structure in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/Control%20Flow.ipynb)
4. [How to compare two Data Frames and merge them based on a condition](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/DF_Comparing_Merging_ConditionalBased.ipynb)
5. [What are the different Data Types in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/Data%20Types.ipynb)
6. [How to convert Data Types in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/DataTypes%20Conversion.ipynb)
7. [What are Dictionaries in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/Dictionary.ipynb)
8. [What are Identifiers in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/Identifiers.ipynb)
9. [What are Lambda functions in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/Lambda%20or%20Anonymous%20Functions.ipynb)
10. [What are Lists in Python](https://github.com/santhoshbvsrk/DataScience-PythonStarters/blob/main/List.ipynb)
